# Insurance Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning models. Various classification algorithms are trained and evaluated to identify fraudulent claims based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains insurance claim details, including categorical and numerical features. Some columns contain missing values, which are handled during preprocessing.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset and replaced missing values (`?` â†’ `np.nan`).
- Handled missing values in `collision_type`, `property_damage`, and `police_report_available`.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using Label Encoding.
- Standardized numerical features for better model performance.

### 2. Model Training & Evaluation
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **AdaBoost**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- **Decision Tree**
- **XGBoost**
- **Stochastic Gradient Boosting**

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC AUC Score**
- **Precision-Recall Curve**

### 3. Results
- The best-performing model achieved a **high ROC AUC score**, indicating strong fraud detection capability.
- Confusion matrices and classification reports provide insights into false positives and false negatives.
- Feature importance was analyzed for tree-based models to understand key factors contributing to fraud detection.

## Key Takeaways for Data Science Roles
This project showcases essential skills for data science roles, including:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Standardization and label encoding for better model performance.
- **Model Selection & Training:** Comparison of multiple classifiers to identify the best model.
